1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.
3. Compile the program using the following command:
4. Follow the instructions to enter the coordinates and see the output.

## Usage

When you run the program, it will ask you to enter the x and y coordinates of a point in the Cartesian plane. After you enter the coordinates, the program will determine which quadrant the point is located in and display the result on the screen.
